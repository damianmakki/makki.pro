			<p>The #1 taxi-booking app in the country. Taxi Magic is one of my favorite clients. We've completed a ton of projects together and thanks to their incredible team, they're a pleasure to work with. Though this is a small sampling, we've completed a number of print projects ranging from holiday cards to custom posters, some great email campaigns, and even a launch page for their New York City launch in June, 2013.</p>
