He and his company were the springboard for my career in design and development. In early 2012, we had some extra time to re-imagine the Vivid logo and identity.</p></div>

I brought out a snipped that would display well on social media sites and in constrained views. The salmon color contrasted well with the dark browns of the background.</p></div>
