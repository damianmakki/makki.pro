					<div class="comments span9"><p>After a few name changes, a few different logos, and a ton of color patterns, neso was born. It's centered around the idea of harmony. The beach. The sun. Spun off from an early idea of a "Neptune" brand, neso is one of Neptune's moons. The neso team suggested a sunburst mark to represent their project. The mark is representative of sunrays, but employs droplets instead of the standard triangular ray.</p></div>
