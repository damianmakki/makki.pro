			<label>Overview</label>
			<p>Sourced Adventures is a tourism and travel company based out of New York City. Their twist is providing all-inclusive day-trips for their guests. With adventures like whitewater rafting, ski and snowboarding trips in the Winter and paintball trips, Sourced Adventures caters to all types of thrill-seekers. I worked closely with to build a complete identity (including logos and styleguides), a brochure website including the ability to purchase and reserve slots on trips. In 2015, I worked with Sourced Adventures to open up “Adventure Cafe” - a coffee shop and adventure basecamp catering primarily to residents of Manhattan’s Lower East Side.</p>
