			<label>Overview</label>
			<p>Lawline provides high-quality continuing legal education (CLE) content to attorneys across the United States. When I was brought on in 2013, there was no previous designer. Everything from email templates to site styleguides had to be completely rebuilt from the ground up. With an imminent site relaunch (September, 2015), Lawline stands alone in the online CLE market.</p>
